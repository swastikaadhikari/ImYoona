	<br><h2>Introduction</h2><br>
 Web development deals with the design part and this is the first assignment given to us after joining college. So, basically we were expected to prepare atleast 6 web pages using HTML and CSS properties. The page are as index page which is also called as landing or first page, about page which should give the short introduction about ourselves including the reason why we aspire to be a developer. CV page contains the information about the experinces, or detailed information using flex properties. Social page include the link to the professional social pages we are connected to and contact page include a form and google map showing our address. The main objective of giving this assignment was to make us understand more about web development and too see our creativity as well. These web pages should be responsive as well and have UI design because it make the web site or pages look more attractive.<br>
 <br><h2>How I Start My Assignment</h2><br>
 After the briefing was done I was so worried about how would i start my assignment and i thought that I wasnot able to understand what was taught in class but after some research I actually knew how should I start my assignment and started coding. I took help of my friends and teacher as well. We discussed about the design part and what should we focus to make the design more attractive. I looked for some of templates, youtube videos to get some more ideas about creating the page. And after that I started coding and lastly completed the website as I want. <br>

 <br><h2>Experience</h2><br>
 Web Development was completely a new term for me and studying in different environment after completing my high school was a new experience as well. Web development refers to the creating of websites and web pages. The very first week we learned about github and some basic html and reaching to the last week we are finally able to design and create our own website. Though, these two words web and development sounds easy but to understand it, is abit harder. We need to focus and be focused on what we learn. Day by day we start to learn new things which will help through us our lifetime. It also make us able to think differently, creating new ideas, the choice for colors and also something out of the box. <br>
 <br>Remembering how my face used to be after finding web development harder than I thought i still laugh because it's all about designing and i feel like i was so poor in design part but now after designing the complete website i am confident that i can do much more than this. In such a such period of time if I am able to create such web pages I guess i will do more better in future as well.<br>
<br>Learning something new is always fun and exciting and i too was excited for learning web. Our tutor was so supportive through out lecture and tutorial time. Due to his support and the way of teaching I am able to do something which I have never imagined of.<br>
<br>If i had more time to learn the wad i guess could have done better than this. I amnot saying that I am perfect and my web pages are perfect as well but atleast i learned throughout the course and was able to complete the whole project on my own. I guess it's the biggest achievement to learn something new and apply it in real life.<br>
<br>We learned about HTML and CSS and it's different properties used to make websites. We applied various features to make our web pages more attrative such as flex properties, padding, margin, animation, responsive design, transition, google fonts, to set the images and so on. Learning these properties helped me through my project to make it look better. So, web development is all about creativity for designing a website.<br>
<br>So lastly, it was quite good experience learning something new and doing something new as well. I hope to learn more and achieve more in upcoming days.<br>

 <br><h2>User Interface Design</h2><br>

 To make myself more clearer about the design I researced some of the templates to make my website look more attractive. User Interface Design refers to the designing of something in simple way to make it look attractive and efficient. The way how we present our webpage reflects our undertsanding, our creativity and knowledge. So, to be the good learner we need to understand how the system works and what users want. User may find simple and eye-friendly color more attractive than of the design mess. I used the following templates because of it's simplicity. In my concept, i think simple is the best sometimes. 
 <br>I discussed with my friends about the design part and they suggested me to use some simple and elegant type of design and I started looking for the templates. The templates i choosed was simple and was user frienldy. My web pages doesn't look similar to the templates but I get some idea of creating web pages which looks simple and user-friendly. We use the UI design to make the web page user-friendly, attractive and in a simple way.<br>
 These are some of the templates I looked for to complete the assignment.<br>
 <br>I started my assignment using these templates. After seeing these templates i get ideas of creating different pages and made it look effective as possible as I can. I created responsive design beacuse most of the people are mobile users than desktop.

<br>This was the simple template for contact page I looked for. It was simple and attractive and it shows the information as I wanted. The Google map is there and our brief also decribes that a google map is required showing our location.<br>

<br><h2>Wireframes</h2><br>
<br>Wireframes is the skeleton diagram of any web pages. It is done by using paper and pencil. Before creating the webpages, I first drew the skeleton diagram for each web pages which is shown below:<br>
<div class="Wireframes">
	<img src="images/15.jpg" alt="15"><br>
	<p>Figure:Home Page</p>
<br>This is wireframe of the homepage. It consists of header, footer and body part. In header part, there is navigation bars and body contains the image, footer part contains some of the information.
	<img src="images/16.jpg" alt="16"><br>
	<p>Figure:About me page</p>
	<br>This is the wireframe of the bio page. It also consists of header, footer and body part. Header and footer is same as the home page but body part contains my information and a photo of mine.<br>
	<img src="images/18.jpg" alt="18"><br>
	<p>Figure= CV page</p><
	<br>This is the wireframe of the CV page. It also consists of header, footer and body part. Body part consists of of my personal details, eductaion, skills and coursework.
	<img src="images/17.jpg" alt="17"><br>

	<br>
</div>
<br><h2>Screen Mockups</h2><br>
These are some of the images how my website look like:
<img src="" alt=""><br>
<p>Fig:Homepage</p>
<img src="" alt=""><br>
<p>Fig: Contact page</p>
<br><h2>HTML Validations</h2><br>
In brief we were asked to validate the code. So, I used the W3 school validator to validate my code and they are shown below:
<div class="Wireframes">
	<img src="images/index.jpg" alt="index">
	<p>Figure: Validation of Homepage</p>
	<img src="images/bio.jpg" alt="bio">

<br><h2> Implementation</h2><br>

<p> Codes of bio page</p>
	
<br><h2> Conclusion</h2><br>
